# Go Tooling in Action

Hi, and welcome to "Go Tooling in Action". This is a multi hour workshop,
so get ready for some intense learning!

After going through the whole content, you will know about what tools can
help you better write Go code, how to build artifacts from that code, and
how to understand the performance of your code once it's running.

## Setting up your workspace

To go through this you will need the following:

1. You have installed the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org).
1. You are somewhat familiar with the basics of Go. (The [Go Tour](https://tour.golang.org) is a pretty good place to start)

## Contents

The workshop is for now composed of three independent sections:

- [1: Source code management](1-source-code/README.md)
- [2: Building artifacts from code](2-building-artifacts/README.md)
- [3: Dynamic program analysis](3-dynamic-analysis/README.md)

In the future one more section might be added regarding monitoring of running
systems, but for now that topic is out of the scope of this workshop.

## Issues

This workshop is very new, so some things might be missing or wrong.

If you find anything that seems broken, please file an issue. Or even better,
send a pull request! You will need to sign a CLA, you'll get the info once
you send the PR.

## Resources

These are places where you can find more information for Go:

- [golang.org](https://golang.org)
- [godoc.org](https://godoc.org), where you can find the documentation for any package.
- [The Go Programming Language Blog](https://blog.golang.org)

My favorite aspect of Go is its community, and you are now part of it too. Welcome!

As a newcomer to the Go community you might have questions or get blocked at some point.
This is completely normal, and we're here to help you.
Some of the places where gophers tend to hang out are:

- [The Go Forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/)
- #go-nuts IRC channel at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/)
- Gophersâ€™ community on [Slack](https://gophers.slack.com/messages/general/) (signup [here](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/) for an account).
- [@golang](https://twitter.com/golang) and [#golang](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23golang) on Twitter.
- [Go+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/1/communities/114112804251407510571) on Google Plus.
- [Go user meetups](https://go-meetups.appspot.com/)
- golang-nuts [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/golang-nuts)
